This simple utility will send a SIGTERM signal to a process
to kill all processes running with that name

Notes:
- Only supports unix-like machines (Tested on Kali)
- The response from LISTALL is not logged since there is plenty of output
- Running "KillAll" launches the server followed by the client

Compilation:
> javac KillAll.java

Usage:
> java KillAll <CMD>

Sample output:

root@kali:/mnt/hgfs/Kali/CSI3131# java KillAll firefox
[Server] Starting on port 8080
[Client] Connecting to localhost on port 8080
[Client] Sending LISTALL message
[Server] Received LISTALL message

[Server] Finished
